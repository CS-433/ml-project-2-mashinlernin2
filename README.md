## Authors: Guillem Bartrina Moreno, Aitor Ganuza Izagirre, Eduardo Pe√±a Royuela

This readme does not provide a detailed description of the functions, for a more in-depth description, please check the comments on the corresponding files.

## Reproducibility
To reproduce our results go through this steps

#### Acquire the data
Download the project data from this link and put it in the **data** folder. https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/FUupj8ht776nY3j

#### Install the requirements
Install the requirements for this project runing ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### Execution
Run  ```python3 worm_tracker.py -I capture.avi -O labels.txt -A capture_annotated.avi ```, where:

- Option ```-I capture.avi``` is the input video whete the tracking will be carried out
- Option ``` -O labels.txt``` is the name of the output labels genereted by the script
- Option ```-A capture_annotated.avi``` generates the video with the annotated pixel that tracks the worm.

Note that the only absolutely necessary parameter is ```-I capture.avi```, the rest are optional and should only be used if you want the text file with the predicted labels or the video with the worm position annotated.
